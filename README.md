## About this Project
This project uses Pandas to analyze district-wide standardized test results for math and reading scores to show trends in school performance. Analysis includes a high level snapshot of the district's key metrics, school's key metrics, top performing schools, bottom performing schools, scores by grade, spending size and school type.

## Insights
* Across the district, students are less likely to pass math than reading. Six out of fifteen schools have passing rates of 67% or lower in math, compared to reading where passing rates are 79% and above. 
* Students at Charter schools in the district are high performing. More students pass reading and math at Charter schools than their peers at District schools. 
* The 'Scores by School Spending' table shows that as school spending increases, students are less likely to pass reading or math.
