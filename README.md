# pandas-challenge

## Description
Used pandas to analyze district-wide standardized test results for math and reading scores to show trends in school performance. Analysis includes a high level snapshot of the district's key metrics, school's key metrics, top performing schools, bottom performing schools, scores by grade, spending size and school type.

## Insights
* Across the district, students are less likely to pass math than reading. Six out of fifteen schools have passing rates of 67% or lower. As a result, the math program throughout the disctrict may need be reassessed to help students succeed.
* Students at Charter schools in the district are high performing. More students pass reading and math at Charter schools than their peers at District schools. 
* The 'Scores by School Spending' table shows that as school spending increases, students are less likely to pass reading or math. Budgets may need to be revisited if this finding does not align with the district's goals.
