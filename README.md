# pandas-challenge

## Description
Used pandas to analyze district-wide standardized test results for math and reading scores to show trends in school performance. Analysis includes a high level snapshot of the district's key metrics, school's key metrics, top performing schools, bottom performing schools, scores by grade, spending size and school type.

## Insights
* Across the district, students are less likely to pass math than reading. Six schools out of fifteen total schools have a 67% passing rate or lower in math. As a result, the math program throughout the disctrict may need be reassessed to so that more students can succeed. 
* Charter schools in the district are high performing. Students at Charter Schools are more likely to pass reading and math than their peers at District schools. 
* Looking at the table 'Scores by School Spending', it's clear that when school spending increases, students are actually less likely to pass reading or math.
