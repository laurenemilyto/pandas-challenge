# pandas-challenge

## Description
Used pandas to analyze district-wide standardized test results for math and reading scores to show trends in school performance. Analysis includes a high level snapshot of the district's key metrics, school's key metrics, top performing schools, bottom performing schools, scores by grade, spending size and school type.

## Insights
* The percent of students passing math is lower than the percent of students passing reading at every school in the district. 6/15 schools have a 67% passing rate or lower in math. As a result of these findings, the math program throughout the disctrict may need be reassessed so that students are more likely to pass the subject. 
* Charter schools in the district are high performing as students more likely to pass reading and math than their peers at District schools. 
* Looking at the Scores by School Spending table, it's clear that as spending increases, students are less likely to pass reading or math.
